# Bolts WP
*1.0.1*

Bolts WP is your new favourite developer theme (at least for WordPress) - tough enough to power (and easily maintain) websites of any shape and size, yet so simple that you can become a power user within a day. It focuses on removing complexity and streamlining development without creating a whole new workflow. Its not trying to recreate the wheel, just make it rounder.

Bolts WP has a modern workflow and many of the build tools youÂ´ve come to love and expect, out of the box:

- **Webpack** for bundling and task running
- **Babel** for transpiling and polyfilling ES6+
- **Sass** with **Autoprefixer**, **CSSNano** and **MQPacker** for styles
- **ESLint**, **Stylelint** and **Prettier** for linting and code formatting
- **Bolts** front-end library

As for the PHP, Bolts WP is component oriented and features helpers to keep your code as DRY as possible. Just use the `component()` function, pass in your data and never write any markup in your page templates again.

The theme also features a lot of handy functions and cleaning defaults, removing bloat and filling WP's blatant gaps, making the workflow more normalized and easy to use.

## Installation
1. Run `git clone` in your themes directory to install the theme
2. Run `npm install` to install all npm packages

## Build scripts
### For development
- `npm run dev` bundles a unminified development version of the theme
- `npm run watch` bundles a development version every time a SCSS or JS file changes

### PHP Defaults
Bolts WP features a couple of defaults used both during the init, but also by some of our functions. They are all configurable with `define()`, that should be done in `functions.php`.
